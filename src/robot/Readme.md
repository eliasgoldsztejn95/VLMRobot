## Robot code

This code integrates VLM state commands with the real robot using ROS1 and the PyROS package. It establishes connections between the robot and various sensors to manage navigation states.

Adaptations may be required depending on the robot's software. The external computer communicates with the robot via WiFi, though a USB connection is also possible, as the computer is mounted on the robot.
